Step 8.2 — Create Xero OAuth 2.0 Login URL and Redirect
This part will let your user (you) click a link → log into Xero → Xero will redirect back to your API with an authorization code.
When you run this URL in your browser:https://localhost:5001/api/xeroauth/login
your Web API should:

Build the Xero OAuth 2.0 authorization URL (inside the controller).

Redirect you to the real Xero login page at`https://login.xero.com/identity/connect/authorize
Then Xero will ask you to log in and allow access for your app.
After you accept, Xero redirects you back to your app’s callback URL:
https://localhost:5001/api/xeroauth/callback?code=XXXXXXXX
es pahin unenq XeroAuthController-@ u ira mej login u callback action methodnery
1.Run your Web API project
Open your browser and go to:https://localhost:5001/api/xeroauth/login
What happens next:
👉 Step A — Your controller’s Login() method runs
ASP.NET automatically finds the route /api/xeroauth/login
It executes your Login() method in XeroAuthController
Inside that method, we:
Build the authorization URL (the full link to Xero’s login page)
Then call return Redirect(...)
👉 Step B — The Redirect(...) sends your browser to Xero
Now your browser leaves your local site and opens
Xero’s official login page:
https://login.xero.com/identity/connect/authorize?...(parameters)...
3️.Log in on Xero page
Enter your email + password (the Xero demo account you created)
Xero will ask if you allow your app (e.g. AccountingSyncApp) to access data
Click Allow access
4️.Xero redirects back to your app
When you click “Allow”, Xero sends your browser back to your callback route:https://localhost:5001/api/xeroauth/callback?code=ABCDEFG12345&state=12345
That means ASP.NET automatically calls your method:[HttpGet("callback")]
public IActionResult Callback([FromQuery] string code, [FromQuery] string state)
The parameter code will contain that long string (ABCDEFG12345)
That code is the authorization code, which we’ll use next to get tokens.
/////////////ABOUT OAuth 2.0///////////////
OAuth 2.0 standard:
Xero uses the OAuth 2.0 protocol. According to the standard:
After a user logs in and approves your app, the authorization server (Xero) must redirect the user to the redirect_uri you registered.

Your project’s role:
We registered the redirect URI in your Xero app settings and referenced it in your Login action.
We created a Callback action in your controller that receives this code.
Your project does not control the redirect itself; Xero does that automatically.
All we do in the callback is catch the code and exchange it for an access token.
Default Xero behavior:
Xero always does this redirect after login + consent for any OAuth 2.0 app.
Without a redirect_uri, the redirect wouldn’t happen — the user would stay on Xero’s page.
//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
step 8.3 is where things get really real: we’ll exchange the authorization code (that Xero sends us after login) for access and refresh tokens, which our backend will later use to call Xero APIs.
| Field           | Meaning                                                                                                          |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `access_token`  | The main token you’ll use to call Xero API endpoints. Expires after `expires_in` seconds (here: 1800 = 30 min).  |
| `refresh_token` | Token used to get a new `access_token` when it expires. Typically lasts 60 days.                                 |
| `expires_in`    | Lifetime of `access_token` in seconds.                                                                           |
| `token_type`    | Usually `"Bearer"`. Needed in Authorization header when calling APIs.                                            |
| `scope`         | Permissions granted to this token. Matches what you requested in Login (`accounting.contacts.read` etc.).        |
| `id_token`      | JWT token containing user info like email, name, Xero user ID. Useful if you want info about the logged-in user. |


Step 8.4 Summary

✔ You created and connected the XeroApiManager, which now handles all HTTP requests to the Xero API.
✔ You implemented logic for:

Customers (Get, Create, Update)

Invoices (Get, Create, Update)

Quotes (planned — if not yet added, we’ll do that next).
✔ You used DTOs (CustomerCreateDto, InvoiceCreateDto, etc.) to separate internal data models from external API payloads.
✔ You connected everything through the dependency injection layer using the stored access token.


Next Step: 8.5 – Sync data

According to the Xero integration flow, the next logical step is:

Step 8.5: Implement synchronization logic
You’ll create a SyncService (for example, XeroSyncService) that:

Reads local data (e.g. from SQL Server)

Sends it to Xero using your _xeroApiManager

Or fetches updated data from Xero and updates your local DB.

In simple terms:
💡 Now that you can “talk” to Xero, you’ll start syncing your app’s data with it.
